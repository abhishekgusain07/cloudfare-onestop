# Background Music System - Project Documentation

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive background music system for the AI UGC Studio that allows users to:
1. **Select Music**: Choose from preset tracks or upload custom audio files
2. **Trim Audio**: Select specific segments of audio tracks with visual waveform interface
3. **Preview Integration**: See real-time audio integration with video content
4. **Session Persistence**: Maintain music selections across browser sessions

### Key Features

#### 🎵 **Core Music Features**
- **Preset Music Library**: Curated collection of background music tracks
- **Custom Upload Support**: Accept MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG audio files
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable audio levels (0-100%)
- **Audio Preview**: Play/pause functionality with visual feedback
- **Format Validation**: Ensure uploaded files are valid audio formats

#### 🎨 **Advanced Audio Editing**
- **Waveform Visualization**: Visual representation of audio for precise editing
- **Trim Interface**: Drag-and-drop handles for selecting audio segments
- **Time-based Editing**: Start/end time controls with precise timing
- **Preview Integration**: Real-time audio playback with selected segments
- **Duration Display**: Show selected segment duration vs. total track length

#### 🔄 **System Integration**
- **Remotion Integration**: Seamless audio rendering in final video output
- **Preview Synchronization**: Live audio preview during video editing
- **Backend Processing**: Audio trimming parameters passed to render system
- **State Management**: Comprehensive audio state across application

### Technical Decisions

#### **Decision 1: User-Uploaded Music Storage**

**Analysis:**
- **Client-Side Approach**: Store uploaded files in browser memory using `URL.createObjectURL()`
- **R2 Cloud Storage**: Upload audio files to Cloudflare R2 bucket

**Pros/Cons Analysis:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Client-Side** | • No server storage costs<br>• Instant file access<br>• No upload delays<br>• Privacy-focused | • Lost on page refresh<br>• Memory limitations<br>• No cross-device access<br>• Limited to session only |
| **R2 Storage** | • Persistent storage<br>• Scalable solution<br>• Cross-device access<br>• Matches video storage pattern | • Upload time delays<br>• Storage costs<br>• Network dependencies<br>• Requires management |

**✅ DECISION: Hybrid Approach**
- **Primary**: Client-side storage for immediate editing sessions
- **Backup**: R2 upload for persistence (optional feature)
- **Rationale**: Prioritizes user experience while offering persistence option

#### **Decision 2: Editing Session Persistence**

**Analysis:**
Users need their complete editing state preserved across sessions, including:
- Selected video template
- Text content and styling
- Music selection and trim settings
- UI preferences

**Persistence Options:**
1. **LocalStorage**: Simple browser storage
2. **IndexedDB**: Complex data storage with file support
3. **Server-side Sessions**: Database-backed persistence

**✅ DECISION: Enhanced LocalStorage Strategy**
```typescript
interface EditorState {
  // Video Selection
  selectedVideo: Video | null;
  
  // Text Configuration
  textContent: string;
  textPosition: 'top' | 'center' | 'bottom';
  textAlign: 'left' | 'center' | 'right';
  fontSize: number;
  textColor: string;
  textOpacity: number;
  
  // Music Configuration
  musicUrl?: string;
  musicVolume: number;
  musicStartTime?: number;
  musicEndTime?: number;
  musicDuration?: number;
  
  // Session Metadata
  lastModified: Date;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

**Rationale**: LocalStorage provides sufficient persistence for typical editing sessions while maintaining simplicity and performance.

### Out of Scope

#### **Excluded Features**
- **Real-time Audio Effects**: Reverb, EQ, compression during editing
- **Multi-track Audio Mixing**: Multiple simultaneous audio tracks
- **Advanced Audio Processing**: Noise reduction, audio enhancement
- **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time multi-user editing
- **Audio-to-Video Sync**: Automatic beat detection and animation sync
