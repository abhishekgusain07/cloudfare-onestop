1. Video File Optimization:
       * `moov atom` placement: If the video's metadata (moov atom) is at the end of the
         file, the entire video must be downloaded before playback can begin, leading to
         significant delays.
       * High Bitrate/Resolution: The video templates might be too high quality (high
         resolution, high bitrate) for efficient streaming and real-time decoding in a web
         browser, especially for a preview.
       * Codec/Profile: While MP4 is common, specific H.264 profiles or encoding settings
         might not be optimal for web streaming.


   2. Network Latency & Bandwidth:
       * Even with Cloudflare R2 (which acts as a CDN), geographical distance between the
         user and the nearest R2 edge location, or the user's local internet connection
         speed, can introduce latency and limit download speeds, causing buffering.


   3. Client-Side Processing Overhead:
       * The Remotion Player, while powerful, still requires the browser to download,
         decode, and render the video in real-time. If the source video is large or complex,
          this can strain the client's CPU/GPU, leading to choppiness or slow starts.

  Plan to Address Laggy Previews:

  Phase 1: Analyze and Optimize Existing Video Assets (No Code Changes Yet)


   1. Analyze Current Video Files:
       * Action: Use a tool like ffprobe (if you have local access) or an online video
         analysis service to inspect a few of your R2-hosted video templates.
       * Focus: Check the moov atom location (should be at the beginning for web streaming),
          video resolution, bitrate, and overall file size.
       * Expected Outcome: Identify if videos are poorly optimized for streaming.


   2. Optimize Video Files for Web Streaming:
       * Action: If the moov atom is not at the beginning, re-process the videos to move it
         to the front (e.g., using ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -movflags faststart output.mp4).
       * Action: Consider creating lower-resolution and lower-bitrate versions of your video
          templates specifically for previews. These smaller files will download much
         faster.
       * Focus: Balance visual quality with file size and streaming performance.
       * Expected Outcome: Smaller, more stream-friendly video files.

  Phase 2: Implement Preview-Specific Asset Serving (Requires Code Changes)


   1. Store Optimized Previews in R2:
       * Action: Upload the newly optimized (lower-resolution/bitrate) preview versions of
         your video templates to a separate prefix in your R2 bucket (e.g., videos/previews/
          vs. videos/originals/).
       * Expected Outcome: Two versions of each video template available in R2.


   2. Modify Backend to Provide Preview URLs:
       * Action: Update the GET /videos endpoint in backend/src/server.ts to return both the
          original (high-quality) R2 URL and the new preview (optimized) R2 URL for each
         video template.
       * Expected Outcome: Frontend receives both URLs for each video.


   3. Update Frontend to Use Preview URLs for Remotion Player:
       * Action: In src/app/create/page.tsx, modify the Player component to use the
         previewUrl for its templateUrl prop, while retaining the originalUrl for the final
         rendering request.
       * Expected Outcome: Remotion Player uses the smaller, faster-loading preview video
         for live playback.

  Phase 3: Consider Advanced Streaming Solutions (Future Consideration)


   1. Dedicated Video Streaming Service:
       * Action: If performance remains an issue at scale, research and consider integrating
          a dedicated video streaming service (e.g., Cloudflare Stream, Mux, Vimeo API).
         These services handle adaptive bitrate streaming, global CDN distribution, and
         advanced playback optimizations automatically.
       * Expected Outcome: Highly optimized and scalable video delivery.
